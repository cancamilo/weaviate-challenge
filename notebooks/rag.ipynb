ETHE has an AUM of $11 billion. If it has “a similar magnitude of outflows” as GBTC, “this would amount to $110 million of average daily outflows or 30% of ETH’s average daily volume on Coinbase,” according to Kaiko. In the past three months, Grayscale’s ETHE traded at up to a 26% discount to its net asset value (NAV). Kaiko researchers noted that once it becomes a spot ETF, it’s “reasonable to expect” outflows or redemptions as that discount narrows. GBTC’s discount to NAV — how much it traded below the value of the fund’s holdings — sharply narrowed after it converted to an ETF. It traded at up to a 17% discount before its conversion but has narrowed over time, allowing many holders to exit GBTC at either the same price they got in or better.  According to YCharts, it’s now at a 0.03% discount for May 24, a level it has hovered around since then.  ETHE’s discount has already narrowed since the Securities and Exchange Commission gave the initial nod to spot Ether ETFs on May 23, though it has yet to begin trading as a spot ETF.

Kaiko analysts also noted that GBTC’s outflows were surpassed by inflows into other Bitcoin ETFs by the end of January. Kaiko concluded even if Ether ETF inflows “disappoint in the short term the approval has important implications for ETH as an asset, removing some of the regulatory uncertainty which has weighed on ETH’s performance over the past year.”  Magazine: Joe Lubin — The truth about ETH founders split and ‘Crypto Google’ Add reaction', 'summary': ' If Grayscale’s slated spot Ether ETF follows the same path as its Bitcoin one, there could be some short-term pressure on the price of ETH.

       "  'content': \"Stablecoin issuers that offer a yield-bearing element to give holders passive income are missing the point of a stablecoin’s core mission, argues Nick van Eck, CEO of stablecoin issuer firm Agora. Instead, these firms should focus on utility, liquidity and means of transaction in a way that reaches as many individuals and businesses as possible, the son of investment management maestro Jan van Eck explained in a May 27 Medium post. Yield-bearing stablecoins have offered a new dimension for decentralized finance users looking to earn interest, but van Eck says such products will likely be classed as security products in many countries and, therefore, restrict customer reach. “Not only does this deprive you of customers, it also deprives you of liquidity providers, vendors, and a higher utility ceiling. Your product is not freely tradeable,” said van Eck, adding:  Examples include Dai (DAI), Ethena's USDe and the Mountain Protocol's USDM. Yield-bearing stablecoins also lack a sufficient margin to sustain business operations, let alone pay for liquidity and expand an ecosystem, the Agora CEO added. The other main issue is that certain stablecoin issuers have formed strong ties with cryptocurrency trading firms such as Circle with Coinbase and Binance’s own BUSD — before started to wind down — which van Eck describes as a model “rife with conflict of interest.” Van Eck said Agora won’t “pick winners and losers” when it launches the Agora digital dollar (AUSD) on Ethereum next month in June. Instead, it will try to work with as many cryptocurrency exchanges, trading firms and fintech firms as possible. He described Tether's USDT  $1.00 as stablecoin 1.0, with Circle’s USD Coin (USDC)and a few issuers expanding on that with improved transparency around reserves, banking partners and regulatory compliance to form the stablecoin 2.0 era.  USDT   $1.00  Van Eck said he hopes AGORA will mark the third iteration of stablecoins focused solely on utility, liquidity and means of transaction.

The next seven largest stablecoins have market caps above $500 million, too. However, van Eck said back in April that there’s still room for a newcomer in the $161.3 billion industry, especially one that offers an alternative model to the likes of Tether and Circle. Van Eck expects the industry to expand to $3 trillion by 2030, an impressive 70.1% compounded annual growth rate. Agora closed a $12 million funding round in April.

Gox-era Bitcoin would “spook the market” and price-pressure the cryptocurrency. Over $9.4 billion worth of Bitcoin is owed to some of Mt. Gox’s 127,000 creditors who have waited to get it back for over ten years after the exchange collapsed in 2014 after multiple unnoticed hacks. Mt. Gox’s final repayment deadline is Oct. 31. Its trustee started contacting creditors in January to confirm their identity and exchange accounts for repayment.  Magazine: Blockchain detectives: Mt.

       "  'content': 'Grayscale’s yet-to-launch spot Ether  ETH  $3,890  exchange-traded fund (ETF) could bleed an average of $110 million per day if it follows a similar pattern to its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in the first month.\\xa0  ETH   $3,890  The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) converted from a closed-end fund to an ETF on Jan. 11, which saw 23% of its assets under management at launch flow out in the first month — totaling $6.5 billion, Kaiko analysts wrote in a May 27 report. ETHE has an AUM of $11 billion. If it has “a similar magnitude of outflows” as GBTC, “this would amount to $110 million of average daily outflows or 30% of ETH’s average daily volume on Coinbase,” according to Kaiko. In the past three months, Grayscale’s ETHE traded at up to a 26% discount to its net asset value (NAV). Kaiko researchers noted that once it becomes a spot ETF, it’s “reasonable to expect” outflows or redemptions as that discount narrows. GBTC’s discount to NAV — how much it traded below the value of the fund’s holdings — sharply narrowed after it converted to an ETF. It traded at up to a 17% discount before its conversion but has narrowed over time, allowing many holders to exit GBTC at either the same price they got in or better.  According to YCharts, it’s now at a 0.03% discount for May 24, a level it has hovered around since then.  ETHE’s discount has already narrowed since the Securities and Exchange Commission gave the initial nod to spot Ether ETFs on May 23, though it has yet to begin trading as a spot ETF.  Related: What comes after spot Ether ETF approvals? Execs weigh in On May 1, ETHE traded at an over 25% discount before steadily narrowing over the month amid speculation the SEC would approve spot Ether ETFs, then quickly reached a 1.28% discount on May 24, YCharts data shows. Kaiko analysts also noted that GBTC’s outflows were surpassed by inflows into other Bitcoin ETFs by the end of January. Kaiko concluded even if Ether ETF inflows “disappoint in the short term the approval has important implications for ETH as an asset, removing some of the regulatory uncertainty which has weighed on ETH’s performance over the past year.”  Magazine: Joe Lubin — The truth about ETH founders split and ‘Crypto Google’ Add reaction',\n",
